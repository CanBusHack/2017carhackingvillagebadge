I used Embitz as an IDE with a Segger J-Link for debugging programming.  The project is setup for this.

You can find EmBitz here:  www.embitz.com

Segger tools can be expensive, but the J-Link EDU is pretty good and is cheaper at around $65.  Just be sure to use it for "educational" purposes only.  I recommend it for "educational" purposes.

I have included the original Kinetis SDK and the files I used in Kinetis Design Studio (for pin assignments and teplate code generation).  Note that I have made modifications to the generated code in the project - I didn't want to go back into KDS and update the pins.

Please note that in the hardware schematics and BOM a K60 part is referenced.  The MK65FN was used instead (almost pin comaptible except for the REFCLK input from the ethernet phy).
