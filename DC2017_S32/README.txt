I used Embitz as an IDE with a Segger J-Link for debugging programming.  The project is setup for this.

You can find EmBitz here:  www.embitz.com

Segger tools can be expensive, but the J-Link EDU is pretty good and is cheaper at around $65.  Just be sure to use it for "educational" purposes only.  I recommend it for "educational" purposes.

You should download the S32 Design Suite from NXP.  I used this tool to reference the examples for the S32.  You may want to use this envornment for development as well.  I am just partial to EmBits and it wasn't too hard to get the S32 working.
