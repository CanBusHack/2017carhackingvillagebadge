DEFCON 25 - 2017 Car hacking Village Badge Notes
------------------------------------------------

    
Connector P3
------------
Location: Bottom of board, just right of the microUSB connector
Appearance: 1x5 pin header (not populated)
Pin 1: Far Left
Description:
    This pin header is the JTAG Debug connector for the primary 
    microcontroller (NXP MK60FX512VLQ15)

Connector P6 
------------
Location: Bottom right of board
Appearance: 3x10 pin header
Pin 1: Top Left
Description:
    This pin header controls which CAN interfaces are routed to
    which OBD2 connector. If the jumpers are set on the left side,
    signals for that CAN interface are routed to the female OBD2 
    conector on the left of the board. If the jumpers are set on 
    the right side, signals for that CAN interface are routed to
    the male OBD2 conector connected via the ribbon cable to 
    connector P5 on the right of the board.

    From top to bottom, the CAN interface mapped to the P6 pins 
    are:

    CAN3  High
    CAN3  Low
    CAN4  High
    CAN4  Low
    CAN1  High
    CAN1  Low
    CAN2  High
    CAN2  Low
    CANFD High
    CANFD Low

    As an example, the stock jumper settings illustrated below
    route CAN1 to the Male OBD2 connector (ribbon cable) and
    CANFD to the Female OBD2 connector.
    . . . CAN3 High
    . . . CAN3 Low
    . . . CAN4 High

Connector P10
-------------
Location: Right ride of board, left of connector P6
Appearance: 1x3 pin header (not populated)
Pin 1: Far Left
Description:
    This pin header is the LIN bus connector.
    Pin 1 is LIN Tx
    Pin 2 is LIN Rx
    Pin 3 if GND
    
Connector P11
-------------
Location: Right side of board, just below Frontt tire of truck overlay
Appearance: 1x5 pin header (not populated)
Pin 1: Far Left
Description:
    This pin header is the JTAG Debug connector for the secondary 
    microcontroller (NXP PS32K144U). Note that this microcontroller
    is not populated on all badges.
    
Connector P12
-------------
Location: Far bottom edge of board, just right of center
Appearance: 1x2 pin header (not populated)
Pin 1: Left
Description:
    This pin header is for connection of automotive ethernet.
    Pin 1 is Positive
    Pin 2 is Negative
